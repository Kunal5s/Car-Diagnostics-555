  "content": "Content for AC vs DC Fast Charging: What's the Difference? goes here. This essential guide for new EV drivers clarifies a fundamental concept in charging. It explains that all batteries store DC power, but the grid supplies AC power. The key difference is where the conversion from AC to DC happens. In AC charging (Level 1 & 2), the conversion happens inside the car using its onboard charger, which limits the speed. In DC fast charging, the conversion happens in the massive charging station itself, allowing it to bypass the car's onboard charger and deliver DC power directly to the battery at much higher speeds. The article covers the use cases for each: AC for daily home charging and DC for long-distance road trips.",
