  "content": "Content for How to React to a Flashing Check Engine Light goes here. This urgent safety bulletin explains the critical difference between a steady check engine light and a flashing one. The article makes it clear that a flashing light signals a severe engine misfire, a condition where unburned fuel is being dumped into the exhaust system. This can rapidly overheat and destroy the expensive catalytic converter, turning a potentially simple repair (like new spark plugs) into a very costly one. The guide provides clear, immediate instructions: reduce speed, avoid heavy acceleration, and get the vehicle to a mechanic as soon as possible. It stresses the importance of not ignoring this warning to prevent thousands of dollars in damage.",
