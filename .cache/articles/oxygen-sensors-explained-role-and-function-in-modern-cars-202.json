  "content": "Content for Oxygen Sensors Explained: Role and Function in Modern Cars goes here. This article provides a detailed exploration of the oxygen (O2) sensor, a key component in a modern vehicle's emission control and engine management system. It explains how O2 sensors measure the oxygen content in the exhaust and send that data to the ECU to maintain the optimal air-fuel ratio. The guide differentiates between upstream and downstream sensors, explaining their unique roles in fuel trim adjustments and catalytic converter monitoring. Readers will learn the common symptoms of a failing O2 sensor, such as poor fuel economy and a lit check engine light, and understand why replacing a faulty sensor is crucial for both the environment and their car's health.",
