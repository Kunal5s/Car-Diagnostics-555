  "content": "Content for What Your ABS and Traction Control Lights Really Mean goes here. This article clarifies what it means when the ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) and TCS (Traction Control System) lights appear on the dashboard. It explains how these two systems work together to maintain vehicle control during hard braking and acceleration. The guide details the most common reason for both lights to illuminate simultaneously: a faulty wheel speed sensor. It also covers other potential causes, such as a failing ABS control module or low brake fluid. Readers will learn whether it's safe to continue driving and what precautions to take, emphasizing that while the primary braking system will still work, these crucial safety features are disabled until the fault is repaired.",
