  "content": "## AI in Diagnostics\n\nArtificial intelligence is revolutionizing car diagnostics. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of sensor data to predict failures before they happen, providing proactive maintenance recommendations. This means fewer breakdowns and safer roads.\n\n### Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)\n\nV2X technology allows vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure. This can prevent accidents, optimize traffic flow, and provide drivers with real-time information about road conditions.",
