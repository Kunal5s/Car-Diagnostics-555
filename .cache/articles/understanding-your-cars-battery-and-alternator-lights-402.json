  "content": "Content for Understanding Your Car's Battery and Alternator Lights goes here. This critical safety article explains the function of the vehicle's charging system warning light (often a battery symbol). It clarifies a common misconception: this light doesn't mean the battery is bad, but rather that the battery is not being charged. The guide explains the role of the alternator in generating power and recharging the battery while the engine is running. It covers the most common causes for the light, such as a failing alternator or a snapped serpentine belt. Crucially, it advises the driver on what to do immediately: turn off all non-essential electronics and drive directly to a repair shop, as the car is running on limited battery power and will soon die.",
