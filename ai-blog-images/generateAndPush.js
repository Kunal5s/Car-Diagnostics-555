// DEPRECATED: This script is no longer in use.
// Image generation logic has been moved into the main application's
// data fetching layer at `src/lib/data.ts`.
//
// This was done to make image generation happen automatically
// when an article is first requested, fulfilling the requirement
// to have images appear instantly with the article content.
//
// This file is kept to avoid breaking changes but can be safely removed.
