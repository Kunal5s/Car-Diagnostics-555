# Car Diagnostics AI

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio. It uses a powerful AI system to generate a complete library of in-depth automotive articles live, on-demand. This provides users with the freshest content possible, directly from the AI.

## Content Strategy: Automated Daily Generation via Firebase

This application uses a sophisticated, automated content pipeline for maximum reliability and freshness.

-   **Firebase Function Backend:** A scheduled Firebase Cloud Function runs daily to generate new, high-quality automotive articles using the Together AI model.
-   **GitHub as a CMS:** Generated articles (as JSON files) are automatically committed and pushed to a designated GitHub repository. This repository acts as a lightweight, version-controlled CMS.
-   **Live Fetching in Next.js:** The Next.js frontend fetches article content directly from the GitHub repository at request time. This ensures the site always displays the latest available content.
-   **Intelligent Caching:** Next.js uses incremental static regeneration (ISR) to cache fetched content, providing a fast user experience while periodically refreshing data from GitHub. The homepage and category pages refresh every 20 minutes, while individual articles are cached for 24 hours.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to configure both the Firebase Function and the Next.js application.

### 1. Firebase Function Setup

The generation script is located in the `functions` directory. You must set the following configuration variables in your Firebase project environment:

```bash
# Your Together AI API Key
firebase functions:config:set keys.together="YOUR_TOGETHER_AI_KEY"

# Your GitHub Personal Access Token (with repo scope)
firebase functions:config:set keys.github="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"

# Your GitHub repository (e.g., "your-username/your-repo-name")
firebase functions:config:set github.repo="your_username/your_repo"
```

After setting the config, deploy your function:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 2. Next.js Application Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your GitHub repository details. This allows the frontend to fetch the articles generated by the Firebase Function.

```
# .env

# Your GitHub repository (e.g., "your-username/your-repo-name")
GITHUB_REPO="your_username/your_repo"

# Optional: Your GitHub Personal Access Token for higher API rate limits.
# This is recommended for production environments.
GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

Once the environment variables are set, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
