  "content": "# Top 10 Most Common OBD2 Codes and What They Mean\n\nThe Check Engine Light can be a source of major anxiety, but it's also a powerful diagnostic tool. When this light illuminates, your car's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD2) system has stored a Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) that points to a specific problem. Here, we demystify the ten most common OBD2 codes, explaining what they mean and their likely causes.\n\n## H2: P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1)\nThis is one of the most frequent codes. It means your car's catalytic converter is not working as efficiently as it should.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Failing Catalytic Converter:** The most expensive possibility, but not always the cause.\n- **Faulty Oxygen (O2) Sensor:** A bad upstream or downstream O2 sensor can falsely trigger this code.\n- **Exhaust Leaks:** A leak before the catalytic converter can throw off O2 sensor readings.\n\n## H2: P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)\nThis code indicates that the engine's air-fuel mixture has too much air and not enough fuel.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Vacuum Leak:** A crack in a vacuum hose is the most common culprit.\n- **Faulty Mass Airflow (MAF) Sensor:** A dirty or failing MAF sensor can under-report airflow.\n- **Clogged Fuel Filter or Weak Fuel Pump:** Prevents enough fuel from reaching the engine.\n\n## H2: P0300 - Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected\nThis code means the computer has detected misfires on more than one cylinder, but can't pinpoint which ones.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Worn Spark Plugs/Wires:** The most basic ignition components are often the cause.\n- **Vacuum Leak:** A large vacuum leak can affect all cylinders.\n- **Fuel Delivery Problems:** A failing fuel pump can starve the entire engine of fuel.\n\n## H2: P0442 - Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Leak Detected (Small Leak)\nYour car's EVAP system prevents gasoline vapors from escaping into the atmosphere.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Loose or Faulty Gas Cap:** This is the simplest and most common fix. Always check this first!\n- **Cracked EVAP Hoses:** The rubber hoses can become brittle and crack over time.\n- **Faulty Purge or Vent Solenoid:** These valves control vapor flow and can get stuck.\n\n## H2: P0135 - O2 Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction (Bank 1, Sensor 1)\nOxygen sensors need to be hot to work correctly. This code means the internal heater in the sensor has failed.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Failed O2 Sensor:** The sensor itself needs to be replaced.\n- **Wiring/Connector Issues:** Damaged wires or a corroded connector leading to the sensor.\n\n## H2: P0401 - Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Flow Insufficient\nThe EGR system reduces emissions by recirculating some exhaust gas back into the engine cylinders.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Clogged EGR Passages:** Carbon buildup can block the flow of exhaust gas.\n- **Faulty EGR Valve:** The valve itself can get stuck closed.\n- **Failed EGR Sensor:** The sensor that monitors flow might be faulty.\n\n## H2: P0128 - Coolant Thermostat (Coolant Temperature Below Regulating Temperature)\nThis code means the engine is not reaching its proper operating temperature quickly enough.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Stuck-Open Thermostat:** This is the most common cause. The thermostat is stuck open, allowing coolant to circulate constantly.\n- **Faulty Coolant Temperature Sensor:** The sensor might be reporting an incorrect temperature.\n- **Low Coolant Level:** Always check your coolant level first.\n\n## H2: P0455 - Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Leak Detected (Large Leak)\nSimilar to P0442, but this indicates a much larger leak in the EVAP system.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Missing Gas Cap:** The most obvious cause.\n- **Large crack in an EVAP hose or charcoal canister.**\n- **Stuck-open purge or vent solenoid.**\n\n## H2: P0101 - Mass Air Flow (MAF) Circuit Range/Performance\nThis code means the signal from the MAF sensor is not what the ECU expects to see for the current engine load and speed.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Dirty MAF Sensor:** Cleaning the sensor with a dedicated cleaner often fixes this.\n- **Vacuum Leak:** A leak after the MAF sensor can cause this issue.\n- **Clogged Air Filter:** A severely restricted air filter can affect MAF readings.\n\n## H2: P0011 - 'A' Camshaft Position - Timing Over-Advanced (Bank 1)\nThis code points to a problem with the variable valve timing (VVT) system.\n\n### H3: Common Causes\n- **Low or Dirty Engine Oil:** The VVT system is operated by oil pressure. This is the first thing to check.\n- **Failed VVT Solenoid (Oil Control Valve):** This solenoid can get stuck or clogged.\n- **Timing Chain/Belt Issues:** More serious mechanical timing issues can also cause this code.",
