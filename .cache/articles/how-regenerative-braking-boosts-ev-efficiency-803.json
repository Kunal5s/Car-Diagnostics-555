  "content": "Content for How Regenerative Braking Boosts EV Efficiency goes here. This article explains one of the most ingenious technologies in electric vehicles. It describes how, unlike traditional cars that waste kinetic energy as heat during braking, EVs can reverse their electric motor to act as a generator. This process recaptures a significant portion of the car's momentum and converts it back into electricity to recharge the battery. The guide explains the concept of 'one-pedal driving,' where simply lifting off the accelerator can slow the car down significantly, and how this is especially efficient in stop-and-go city traffic. It's a clear explanation of a key feature that makes EVs so efficient.",
