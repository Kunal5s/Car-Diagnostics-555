# Car Diagnostics AI

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio. It uses a powerful AI system to generate a complete library of in-depth automotive articles live, on-demand. This provides users with the freshest content possible, directly from the AI.

## Content Strategy: Automated Daily Generation via Vercel Cron Job

This application uses a sophisticated, automated content pipeline for maximum reliability and freshness, designed for deployment on Vercel.

-   **Vercel Cron Job Backend:** A scheduled Vercel Cron Job runs daily to generate new, high-quality automotive articles using the Together AI model and images using the Pollinations AI model.
-   **GitHub as a CMS:** Generated articles (as JSON files) and images (as JPGs) are automatically committed and pushed to designated GitHub repositories. These repositories act as a lightweight, version-controlled CMS.
-   **Live Fetching in Next.js:** The Next.js frontend fetches article content directly from the GitHub repository at request time. This ensures the site always displays the latest available content.
-   **Intelligent Caching:** Next.js uses incremental static regeneration (ISR) to cache fetched content, providing a fast user experience while periodically refreshing data from GitHub. The homepage and category pages refresh every 20 minutes, while individual articles are cached for 24 hours.

## Getting Started on Vercel

To run this project, you need to configure both the Vercel project environment and the Next.js application.

### 1. Vercel Project Setup

The generation script is located at `/src/app/api/cron/route.ts` and is triggered by the configuration in `vercel.json`.

You must set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

-   `TOGETHER_API_KEY`: Your API key for Together AI.
-   `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (with `repo` scope).
-   `GITHUB_REPO`: Your GitHub repository for article JSON files (e.g., "your-username/your-content-repo").
-   `GITHUB_IMAGES_REPO`: Your GitHub repository for generated images (e.g., "your-username/your-images-repo").
-   `CRON_SECRET`: A secret key you create to secure the cron job endpoint. This can be any long, random string.

After setting the variables, deploy your project to Vercel. The cron job will be automatically scheduled.

### 2. Local Development Setup

For local development, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. This allows the frontend to fetch the articles generated by the cron job.

```bash
# .env.local

# Required for the frontend to fetch articles from GitHub
GITHUB_REPO="your_username/your_repo" 

# Optional: For higher API rate limits when fetching from the GitHub API
GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" 
```

Once the environment variables are set, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
