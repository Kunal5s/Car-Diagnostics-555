# AI Blog Images Script (DEPRECATED)

This script is no longer used. The logic for generating images has been integrated directly into the main Next.js application at `src/lib/data.ts`.

This change was made to ensure that images are generated automatically and on-demand when a user first visits an article, rather than requiring a separate, manual script run.

Please refer to the main project's `README.md` for setup instructions.
