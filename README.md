This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio.

## Content Strategy

This application uses a robust and reliable content strategy to ensure a fast, engaging, and always-available experience for users.

- **Pre-Generated Content:** To ensure 100% reliability and lightning-fast speed, this website uses a pre-generated library of 54 high-quality articles stored in `src/lib/articles.json`. This eliminates any reliance on external APIs that can cause errors or slowdowns.
- **Daily Homepage Refresh:** To keep the experience fresh, the homepage automatically shuffles the article library every 24 hours to feature a new set of 6 "trending" articles.
- **No API Keys Needed:** This content strategy means **you do not need to provide any API keys or configure any environment variables** for the site to work. The website is fully functional out of the box.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.
