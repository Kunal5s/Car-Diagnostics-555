# Car Diagnostics AI

This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio. It uses a powerful AI system to generate fresh, in-depth articles on automotive topics daily, with a smart caching system powered by Supabase to ensure reliability and performance.

## Getting Started

This project requires **two environment variables** to be set up for the AI features to work, and a **one-time database setup** on Supabase.

### 1. Required Environment Variables

This project requires two API keys to function correctly. How you set them depends on whether you are running the project locally (in this development environment) or on a live hosting platform like Vercel.

#### **For Local Development (Mandatory)**

For the website to work in this development environment, you **must** use a local environment file.

1.  A `.env` file has been created for you in the project's root directory.
2.  The OpenRouter key you provided has already been added.
3.  You still need an Unsplash key for images. You can get a free key from the [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers) page and add it to the `.env` file.

The file content should look like this:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="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"
UNSPLASH_API_KEY="your_unsplash_api_key_here"
```
> **IMPORTANT:** Without these keys in the `.env` file, the article and image generation will fail in this local environment. You can get a free OpenRouter API key from the [OpenRouter website](https://openrouter.ai/).

#### **For Production Hosting (e.g., Vercel)**

When you deploy your website to a hosting service like Vercel or Firebase App Hosting, you must set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `UNSPLASH_API_KEY` as environment variables in your project's settings on that platform. The `.env` file is not used in production.

### 2. Supabase Database Setup

**This step is mandatory.** The application uses Supabase as a cache to store generated articles, which makes the site fast and reliable. You need to create a table in your Supabase project and set the correct access policies.

1.  Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
2.  In the left menu, navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Click **+ New query**.
4.  Copy the entire SQL script below and paste it into the query editor.
5.  Click **Run**.

```sql
-- This script sets up your database for the project.
-- It will delete any existing 'articles' table to ensure a clean setup.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.articles;

-- Create the table for caching articles
CREATE TABLE public.articles (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    image_url TEXT,
    generated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add comments to the columns for clarity in the Supabase UI
COMMENT ON TABLE public.articles IS 'Cache for AI-generated articles to improve performance and reliability.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.articles.slug IS 'The unique URL-friendly identifier for the article.';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.articles.generated_at IS 'The timestamp when the article was last generated and cached.';


-- Enable Row Level Security on the table
ALTER TABLE public.articles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy to allow public read access
-- This allows anyone to read the articles from the cache.
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON public.articles
FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Create a policy to allow public insert access
-- This allows the app to save new articles to the cache.
CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert access" ON public.articles
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create a policy to allow public update access
-- This allows the app to update existing articles in the cache.
CREATE POLICY "Allow public update access" ON public.articles
FOR UPDATE USING (true);
```

> **IMPORTANT:** If you do not perform this database setup step correctly, the website will show a "Database Configuration Error" on the article pages. The SQL script above creates the table and all the necessary permissions at once.

After running this script, your database will be correctly configured to work with the application.

## Content Strategy: The Best of Both Worlds

This application uses a hybrid content strategy to provide fresh daily content while ensuring maximum reliability and performance.

-   **Dynamic AI Generation:** When a user visits an article page for the first time on any given day, the content is generated in real-time by the powerful `meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct` model via OpenRouter.
-   **Dynamic Image Fetching:** At the same time, an image relevant to the article's topic is fetched from the Unsplash API.
-   **Supabase Smart Caching:** Once an article and its image are generated/fetched, they are automatically saved (cached) in your Supabase database for 24 hours. Any other user who visits that same article on the same day will be served the content instantly from the Supabase cache, not from the AI.
-   **Reliability & Performance:** This "generate-once, serve-many" approach dramatically reduces API calls, lowers costs, and ensures the site is fast and reliable, avoiding the errors and timeouts common with live AI generation on every page load.
-   **Static Topic Base:** The site is built on a stable foundation of 60 curated article topics. This ensures that all category pages and article URLs are permanent and SEO-friendly.
-   **Daily Homepage Refresh:** To keep the experience fresh, the homepage automatically shuffles the article topics every 24 hours to feature a new set of 6 "trending" articles.

This hybrid model provides the dynamic, AI-powered content you want with the stability and performance that a professional website requires.
