  "content": "# Diagnosing Issues With Your Car's Tire Pressure Sensors\n\nThe Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning light is a common sight on modern dashboards. While it's a vital safety feature, it can also be a source of confusion. This guide will help you understand what the TPMS light means, how to diagnose common problems, and when you need to seek professional help.\n\n## How Does TPMS Work?\nThere are two main types of TPMS systems:\n\n### Direct TPMS\nThis is the most common type. Each wheel has a small, battery-powered sensor, usually attached to the valve stem, that directly measures the tire's pressure. It wirelessly transmits this data to the car's computer. If the pressure drops below a certain threshold (usually 25% below the recommended pressure), the TPMS warning light illuminates.\n\n### Indirect TPMS\nThis system does not use dedicated pressure sensors. Instead, it uses the car's anti-lock brake system (ABS) wheel speed sensors. It infers that a tire is low on pressure because an under-inflated tire will have a slightly smaller diameter and rotate faster than the other tires. This system is less accurate and cannot tell you which specific tire is low.\n\n## Solid vs. Flashing TPMS Light: What's the Difference?\nThis is the most important diagnostic clue.\n\n### Solid TPMS Light\nA **solid, non-flashing** light means that one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. This is a pressure issue. \n-   **What to do:** Find a safe place to pull over and visually inspect your tires. Use a reliable tire pressure gauge to check the pressure in all four tires. Inflate any low tires to the pressure recommended on the sticker inside your driver's doorjamb. The light should turn off after driving for a few minutes.\n\n### Flashing TPMS Light\nIf the TPMS light **flashes for 60-90 seconds** when you first start the car and then stays solid, this indicates a **malfunction in the TPMS system itself**. This is a system issue, not a pressure issue. \n-   **What to do:** Your tires' pressures are likely fine, but the system isn't working correctly. You'll need to have the system diagnosed by a professional.\n\n## Common Causes of a Flashing TPMS Light\n\n### 1. Dead Sensor Battery\nDirect TPMS sensors are powered by small, sealed batteries that typically last 5-10 years. When a battery dies, the sensor stops transmitting, and the car's computer reports a system fault. The battery is usually not replaceable, so the entire sensor must be replaced.\n\n### 2. Damaged Sensor\nTPMS sensors can be damaged during tire changes, by hitting a pothole, or from corrosion. A damaged sensor will need to be replaced.\n\n### 3. Sensor Relearn Procedure Needed\nAfter a sensor is replaced or tires are rotated, a 'relearn' procedure is often required to tell the car's computer the new position or ID of the sensors. Tire shops have special tools to perform this procedure.\n\n### 4. Spare Tire Issues\nSome vehicles have a full-size spare tire that is also equipped with a TPMS sensor. If the pressure in this spare tire is low, it can sometimes trigger the TPMS light.\n\n## Conclusion: A Vital Safety Feature\nWhile the TPMS light can be annoying, it's a crucial safety feature. Properly inflated tires are essential for safe handling, braking, and fuel economy. By understanding the difference between a solid and flashing light, you can quickly determine whether you have a simple pressure issue you can fix yourself or a system malfunction that requires professional attention.",
