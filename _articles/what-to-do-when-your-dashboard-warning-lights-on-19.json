  "content": "# What to Do When Your Dashboard Warning Lights Are On\n\nYour car's dashboard is its primary communication tool, using a variety of symbols and lights to give you critical information about its health. When a new light illuminates, it's a signal that something needs your attention. Ignoring these warnings can lead to minor issues becoming major, costly repairs. This guide will help you understand what to do when a warning light comes on, how to interpret the most common symbols, and when you need to seek professional help.\n\n## First Steps: Don't Panic, Assess the Situation\nThe first rule is to remain calm. Panicking can lead to poor decisions. Your next action depends heavily on the color and symbol of the warning light.\n\n### Understanding the Color Code\nDashboard lights generally follow a traffic light color system:\n- **Green or Blue:** These lights are typically informational. They indicate that a system is active, such as your high beams or cruise control. No immediate action is required.\n- **Yellow or Orange:** This color indicates a potential issue or a service that is needed soon. It's a caution signal. You should check the issue as soon as possible, but you can usually continue driving safely.\n- **Red:** This is a critical warning. A red light signifies a potentially serious problem that requires immediate attention. In most cases, you should pull over safely and turn off the engine as soon as possible.\n\n## Decoding Common Warning Lights\nHere are some of the most important warning lights and what they mean.\n\n### Check Engine Light (Yellow/Orange)\nThis is perhaps the most infamous light. It's a general-purpose warning from your engine management system. The cause can be anything from a loose gas cap to a serious engine misfire. If it's solid, get the vehicle checked soon. If it's flashing, the problem is severe (like a major misfire that could damage the catalytic converter), and you should pull over immediately.\n\n### Oil Pressure Warning Light (Red)\nThis light, which looks like an old-fashioned oil can, indicates a loss of engine oil pressure. This is one of the most serious warnings. Without proper oil pressure, your engine can be catastrophically damaged in a matter of minutes. Pull over safely and turn off the engine immediately. Do not restart the engine until the oil level has been checked and the problem diagnosed.\n\n### Engine Temperature Warning Light (Red)\nThis symbol, usually resembling a thermometer in water, means your engine is overheating. Continuing to drive an overheating engine can cause severe damage like a warped cylinder head. Pull over, turn off the engine, and let it cool down completely before attempting to check coolant levels. \n\n### Battery / Charging System Light (Red)\nThis light, shaped like a car battery, indicates that the vehicle's electrical system is no longer being properly charged by the alternator. Your car is running solely on battery power and will eventually die. Turn off all non-essential electrical accessories (like the radio and A/C) and drive directly to a mechanic.\n\n### Brake System Warning Light (Red)\nThis could be indicated by the word \"BRAKE\" or a circle with an exclamation point inside. It can mean several things: the parking brake is engaged, the brake fluid is low, or there is a more serious issue with the brake system. If the light remains on after disengaging the parking brake, have your brake system inspected immediately.\n\n## What to Do Next\n\n### Consult Your Owner's Manual\nYour vehicle's owner's manual is the definitive guide to every symbol on your dashboard. Always refer to it if you are unsure about a light's meaning.\n\n### Use an OBD2 Scanner\nFor a yellow Check Engine Light, an OBD2 scanner can read the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) that triggered the light. This provides a specific starting point for diagnosis, helping you understand if the issue is minor or major.\n\n### When to Call a Professional\nFor any red warning light, or if you are uncomfortable diagnosing the problem yourself, it's always safest to call a professional mechanic. Driving with a serious, unaddressed issue can endanger you and other drivers, and often leads to far more expensive repairs down the road. Prioritize safety above all else.",
